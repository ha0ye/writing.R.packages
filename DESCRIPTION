Description: R packages are a powerful way to share code and data across your individual projects, with colleagues, or even with the broader scientific community. They can also form the basis for a Research Compendium to share data analysis work reproducibly. This workshop will introduce the basics of creating custom R packages for personal use and for sharing!
